# In order to make this embedder more general, we need to consider all possible output cases:
# 1. [*] `geo_in_feat` and `src_feat`, where `geo_in_feat` is used as final geometry feature in `VolumetricVideoNetwork.compute_geometry()` to decode `density` and `geo_feat`, and `src_feat` is used as part of appearance feature in `IbrEmbedder.forward()` to decode `rgb`;
# 2. [*] `geo_in_feat` and `app_feat`, where `geo_in_feat` is used as final geometry feature in `VolumetricVideoNetwork.compute_geometry()` to decode `density` only, and `app_feat` is used as final appearance feature in `IbrEmbedder.forward()` to decode `rgb`;
# 3. [*] `density` and `src_feat`, in cases where we already have `density` computed before or computed here, and `src_feat` is used as part of appearance feature in `IbrEmbedder.forward()` to decode `rgb`;
# 3. [*] `density` and `app_feat`, in cases where we already have `density` computed before or computed here, and `app_feat` is used as final appearance feature in `IbrEmbedder.forward()` to decode `rgb`;
# Therefore, we organize the output format of this embedder as: explicitly return geometry related variables, and implicitly store appearance related variables in `batch.output.app_feat` for appearance regressor to use.
